4. Build the iterations (at most 2) that will compose your Milestone 1.0. Record the total days of work and the time it will take for your team to complete that work.

(Oct 4 - Nov 8  - 1Milestone, 2 iterations) Total days of work = 26 days 
(Nov 9 - Dec 13  - 2Milestone ) Total days of work 20 days


5. Make sure you have dealt with velocity before breaking into iterations.

        Milestone -I 
             Velocitiy = 30% or 0.3 per person
        4(person) X 26(days) X 0.3(V)  = 31 amount of work for 1 Milestone
        
        Milestone - II
              Velocity = 30% or 0.3 per person
         4(person) X 20(days) X 0.3(V)  = 24 amount of work for 1 Milestone    
            


6. Allocate tasks to each team member and record the allocation.
    1. Create splash screen - Alaa
